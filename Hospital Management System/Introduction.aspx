                A hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with specialized medical and nursing 
                staff and medical equipment.[1] The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, which typically has
                 an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to
                 a heart attack. A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with a
                 large number of beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care. 
                Specialized hospitals include trauma centers, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors'
                 (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment 
                (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories. Specialized hospitals can help reduce health care
                 costs compared to general hospitals.[2] Hospitals are classified as general, specialty, or government
                 depending on the sources of income received.</p>
