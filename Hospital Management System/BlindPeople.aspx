                Theory of mind (ToM), generally defined as the ability to impute mental states to oneself and others (Premack and Woodruff 1978), is integral to the process of communication. Because what is normally said does not fully determine what is actually meant (Sperber and Wilson 2002), it is constantly necessary for listeners to make inferences about a speaker’s mental states in order to understand their messages, judge their behaviour, and predict their responses. This (at least partially) is possible through observing the speaker’s actions, facial expressions, gestures and other non-verbal cues. Among other things, visual cues allow an individual to recognise a conversation partner’s attitude or attentional direction; to monitor their understanding of a message (Clark and Krych 2004), or to surrender the floor when the partner wishes to take a turn (Kendon 1967; Agryle 1973; Bavelas et al. 2002). It appears clear that vision has the power to provide important information about people’s mental states, but whether the lack of visual cues impairs ToM is far from obvious.

            <p>One may expect that blind people who are deprived of visual information and can only rely on linguistic experience, will be less successful in inferring other people’s communicative intentions. In other words, the information which people with visual impairments (VI) have access to and which should allow them to attribute mental states to their conversation partners, is different from the information accessible to people with normal vision. Hence, it appears well-justified to ask whether the amount of information accessible to blind people during daily communication allows them to successfully “read other people’s minds”. Without knowing whether linguistic information can effectively compensate for the missing visual cues, it is not possible to ascertain whether people who are blind should have visual information verbally provided to them during communication in order to improve their understanding of messages. Therefore, the aim of this article is to explore ToM use in blind people and to investigate whether these individuals, if provided with no visual information, can be as successful in recognising other people’s mental states in communicative situations as people who are sighted.</p>
