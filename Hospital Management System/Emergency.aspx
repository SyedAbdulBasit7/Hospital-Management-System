                Our emergency department is resourced with a highly competent and trained casualty and trauma staff, with a 24 hour backup of cardiologists and a coronary unit. The use of modern technology allows prompt diagnosis and hence a higher possibility of precision in treatment within the short critical time period available during an emergency. Two major upgrades were made in the department last year: the recent ECG machines that operate through a laptop and allow virtual data sharing with any medical specialists in an instant, and the defibrillator with pacer, which allows the medical staff to treat emergency cases in an efficient manner.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Department has 16 beds in total, with one fully equipped Resuscitation Room, a minor OT, Cold Area, Triage and Procedure Room. The most recent addition to the Emergency Department has been a paediatric ER.
