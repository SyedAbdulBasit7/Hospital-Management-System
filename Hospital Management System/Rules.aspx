                <li><h3 style="color:black">Never go alone:</h3> Always bring someone else—a trusted family member or friend—with you. That person will be your primary advocate, and can serve as an extra set of eyes and ears to help make sure you are safe. (This tip applies to routine doctors’ appointments too; always bring your advocate with you.)</li>
               <li><h3 style="color:black"> Determine, in advance, the goals of the hospitalization.</h3>Before you go to the hospital, ask your doctor why you need to be hospitalized. Is it necessary, or is outpatient care possible? What is the goal of the hospital stay? How often will that goal be assessed? Can you choose which hospital to go to, and when you should go? Rarely is the need for hospitalization so emergent that you can’t get these answers and discuss them with your doctor in advance.</li>
                <li><h3 style="color:black">Prepare.</h3>Bring all the things you would normally bring with you to a doctor’s appointment, including a list of your medical problems and allergies. Don’t assume that the hospital will have your records. It’s very important to bring all the pill bottles that you take so that there will be no mistake about what dosage and how often you take your medications. Keep your main doctor’s phone number and your advocate’s phone number handy (though your advocate should be going with you to the hospital).</li>
                <li><h3 style="color:black"> Meet your care team</h3> Find out who is in charge of your care: is it your regular doctor or a hospitalist doctor? Introduce yourself to her, and to your primary nurse. Meet the patient care tech, the nursing assistant, and the other members of your healthcare team. Tell them about yourself, and find about them. The more they get to know you as a person now, the more they will help to answer your questions later. Your advocate should also get to know your care team.</li>
                <li><h3 style="color:black">Know who to call for help and how</h3>Who will be the night-duty doctor and nurse, and how can you reach them? If you are in trouble, or if your advocate sees you’re in trouble, how will you get help? Many hospitals have a “rapid response team” or a “code team” that come to assist in emergency situations. Can your advocate activate this team himself?</li>
