                It is important to make time to care for ourselves, because optimal health is key to an active and meaningful life. We want the very best healthcare so that we will be around for our children and grandchildren, and will be able to travel and enjoy the other pleasures of retirement. Yet we want premier service with minimal waiting and cost.
